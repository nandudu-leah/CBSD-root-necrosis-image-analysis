# CBSD root necrosis image analysis
 The Genetic Study of Root Necrosis Images in the C2 Population involves a comprehensive exploration of the heritability, Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), and identification of candidate genes associated with CBSD root necrosis traits. This research delves into understanding the genetic basis of root necrosis, a critical trait impacting Cassava health and productivity. Through rigorous analysis, the study aims to unravel the genetic factors, determine significant genomic regions, and identify potential genes responsible for these traits within the C2 population.
